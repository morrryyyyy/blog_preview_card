## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Rem units for better scalability
- Figtree google font
- Hover effects and transitions

### What I learned
This was my first time working with a card layout from scratch and applying semantic HTML with custom properties. I also practiced using rem instead of px, and how to organize my CSS for better readability.
I also learned how to:
- center a container vertically and horizontally using flexbox
- add hover effects for better user interactivity

```css
/* Create variables for colors */
:root {
  --yellow: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray500: hsl(0, 0%, 42%);
  --gray950: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
}

.container {
  max-width: 18.75rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
```

### Continued development
I’d like to continue improving my understanding of:
  - Responsive design and media queries
  - Accessibility best practices (like using aria labels and better semantics)
  - Organizing CSS more cleanly using a methodology like BEM or utility classes

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks centering guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - This article helped me with centering the container correctly.
